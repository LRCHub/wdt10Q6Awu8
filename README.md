[00:11.76] Do you think about me when you're all alone?
[00:12.74] The things we used to do, we used to be
[00:16.36] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[00:20.11] I could be the one to set you free
[00:37.11] 
[00:23.86] Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
[00:27.58] It used to be so easy, you and me
[00:31.06] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[00:34.95] I could be the one to set you free
[00:51.95] 
[01:09.33] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[01:12.54] I could be the one to set you free
[01:16.10] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[01:19.98] I could be the one to set you free

[01:57.59] When you need to find a way to breathe
[02:01.23] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[02:04.88] I could be the one to set you free
[02:21.88] 
[02:08.81] If you never see me when the crowd is gone
[02:12.67] It used to be so easy, can't you see?
[02:16.45] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[02:19.96] I could be the one to set you free
[02:36.96] 
[02:24.12] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[02:27.45] I could be the one to set you free
[02:31.14] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[02:34.92] I could be the one to set you free
[03:09.14] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[03:12.30] I could be the one to set you free
[03:16.10] I could be the one to make you feel that way
[03:19.71] I could be the one to set you free
